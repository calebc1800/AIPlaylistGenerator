# AIPlaylistGenerator

The main purpose of the AI Playlist Generator project is to create a website that lets users create and share music playlists that are generated by AI prompts, and connect those playlists to their account on a music app such as Spotify. A user can also manually add or remove songs from a playlist after it is AI-generated to better match their preferences. Playlists can be shared publicly or privately by friending other users on the service, and users can rate playlists with a like/dislike system to promote the best playlists to the top of the public rankings. The stakeholders for this project are music listeners seeking fresh music, and listeners who want a social aspect for sharing music.
